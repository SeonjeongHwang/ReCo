Passage: 
(1) There was a new maths teacher and some new students in the school.
(2) One of the new students named Karl was very confused.
(3) The other students tried to explain   numbers to him, but he didn't understand.
(4) Before Karl arrived, maths was the most boring lesson of all.
(5) Now it was great fun.
(6) The children would listen to Karl and correct his mistakes.
(7) They all wanted to be the first to find his mistakes, and then tried to think up the best ways to explain them.
(8) But little Lewis was sure that Karl felt sad and wanted to talk with him.
(9) So, one day, he decided to walk after Karl after school.
