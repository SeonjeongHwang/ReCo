### Example 1

Passage: 
(1) There was a new maths teacher and some new students in the school.
(2) One of the new students named Karl was very confused.
(3) The other students tried to explain   numbers to him, but he didn't understand.
(4) Before Karl arrived, maths was the most boring lesson of all.
(5) Now it was great fun.
(6) The children would listen to Karl and correct his mistakes.
(7) They all wanted to be the first to find his mistakes, and then tried to think up the best ways to explain them.
(8) But little Lewis was sure that Karl felt sad and wanted to talk with him.
(9) So, one day, he decided to walk after Karl after school.

Statement: The students tried to think up the best ways to explain to Karl.  

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Analyze the Statement
   - Content words: students, tried, think up, best ways, explain, Karl

2. Locate Supporting Evidence in the Passage
   - Sentence (7): "They all wanted to be the first to find his mistakes, and then tried to think up the best ways to explain them."

3. Compare the Statement and the Evidence
   - The phrase "tried to think up the best ways to explain" is identical in both.
   - "They" refers to "the students" (anaphora resolution).
   - "Them" refers to Karl’s mistakes, which are already established as the object of explanation in the context.
   - The statement replaces "them" with "to Karl," making the referent explicit.

4. Determine Whether Inference Is Required
   - No inference is needed.
   - All meaning is derived directly from the passage with basic anaphora resolution.

Answer: Non-inference

### Example 2

Passage: 
(1) The Chinese tradition of giving gifts of money in red envelopes at Lunar New Year has turned into big business for Web giants Alibaba and Tencent, which now both offer electronic "hong bao".
(2) At the end of each lunar year, it is common in China to give children hong bao -- some money in envelopes that are red, the colour of success.
(3) It is now possible to exchange "red envelopes" with smartphone, which is popular in China and has caused a battle  for the mobile payment market between the two companies providing the service, Tencent and Alibaba.
(4) The idea was introduced in 2014 by WeChat, a mobile messaging system with over 400 million users and run[:]by Tencent, China's largest Internet service system.
(5) It was successful at once.
(6) This year, Alipay Wallet , the payment system run by Alibaba, is ready to take on the competition.
(7) It is allowing its 190 million users to send digital gifts, especially on the Twitter-like Sina Weibo.
(8) For the past few weeks a digital battle has been terrible, with Tencent banning  Alipay from sending red envelopes on WeChat, saying they were at a risk.
(9) Recently, WeChat also blocked  Alibaba's music app Xiami.
(10) To attract the public's attention, the two companies have launched lotteries through which they award red envelopes to users in an online game.
(11) It's easy to send and receive hong bao or take part in the lotteries: you simply need to register  your bank details.

Statement: The idea of electronic red envelope was introduced by Wechat in 2014. 

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Analyze the Statement
   - Content words: idea, electronic, red envelope, introduced, WeChat, 2014

2. Locate Supporting Evidence in the Passage
   - Sentence (4): "The idea was introduced in 2014 by WeChat, a mobile messaging system..."

3. Compare the Statement and the Evidence
   - The phrase "The idea was introduced in 2014 by WeChat" appears in the evidence.
   - From prior context (sentences 1–3), "the idea" clearly refers to electronic red envelopes → anaphora resolution
   - The statement restates this explicitly.

4. Determine Whether Inference Is Required  
   - No inference is needed.
   - The statement directly restates the passage with simple anaphora resolution.

Answer: Non-inference

### Example 3

Passage: 
(1) A young man woke up one morning under a bridge and checked his pocket.
(2) All he had left was less than ten dollars.
(3) He bought food and as he sat down to eat, an old man and two children came along.
(4) The old man asked him to help them with food as they had not eaten for almost a week.
(5) The young man looked at the children---they were so weak that they could hardly stand.
(6) With the last bit of kindness he had he gave them all the food.
(7) The old man and children thanked the young man and then gave him a dirty old coin.
(8) The young man said, "You need this coin more than I do--- just keep it."
(9) The old man insisted  that the young man put it in his pocket---and finally he did.
(10) The old man and children sat down to eat.
(11) And with no money, no job and no food, the young man went back under the bridge to lie down.

Statement: The young man thought the old man needed the coin more than he did.  

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Analyze the Statement  
   - Content words: young man, thought, old man, needed, coin, more, he did

2. Locate Supporting Evidence in the Passage  
   - Sentence (8): The young man said, "You need this coin more than I do--- just keep it."

3. Compare the Statement and the Evidence  
   - Statement rephrases the direct quote into indirect speech.
   - "Thought" replaces "said" as a paraphrase capturing the meaning.
   - "You" and "I" in the quote correspond to "the old man" and "he" in the statement → anaphora resolution.

4. Determine Whether Inference Is Required  
   - No inference is needed; the statement is a restatement of explicit content via paraphrase and pronoun resolution.

Answer: Non-inference

### Example 4

Passage: 
(1) Without any previous notice, a documentary dominated headlines and social websites over the weekend.
(2) Under the Dome, a 103-minute documentary self-funded by former CCTV news anchor Chai Jing was released on video-sharing websites in China on Feb 28.
(3) It has rapidly pushed the public awareness about air pollution and encouraged people to join in efforts to make a difference.
(4) Chai, 39, said she started the work out of her "personal clashes" with smog after she gave birth to a daughter.
(5) "I sealed tight all the windows.
(6) I started every day by checking the air pollution index," Chai said.
(7) Millions of other people are also doing the same.
(8) While they stop there, Chai goes deeper.
(9) "I don't want to live in this way.
(10) 1 need to find out where the smog comes from and what on earth is going on."

Statement: The documentary was made by Chai jing, who no longer works in CCTV.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Analyze the statement  
   - Content words: “documentary,” “made,” “Chai Jing,” “no longer works,” “CCTV”

2. Locate supporting evidence in the passage  
   - Sentence (2): “...a 103-minute documentary self-funded by former CCTV news anchor Chai Jing...”

3. Compare content words and expressions  
   - “Made by Chai Jing” aligns with “self-funded by... Chai Jing”
   - “No longer works in CCTV” is a paraphrase of “former CCTV news anchor”  
   - Order of information is slightly different, but meaning is preserved  
   - Chai Jing is explicitly named, and the documentary is clearly attributed to her

4. Determine whether inference is required  
   - “Former CCTV news anchor” → “no longer works in CCTV” is standard paraphrasing (not inference)  
   - Self-funded by Chai Jing" is a direct indication of authorship.
   - These relationships are semantically transparent and do not rely on reasoning beyond the text.
   - No inference is needed.

Answer: Non-inference

### Example 5

Passage: 
(1) Hello!
(2) My name is Kitty.
(3) I want to talk about my home town today.
(4) My home town is small but pretty.
(5) It's about two hours away from London by train.
(6) In the centre of the town there is a small lake.
(7) There are lots of trees and flowers around the lake.
(8) My parents often walk around the lake at the weekend.
(9) The air in my home town is very fresh   and clean.
(10) There are two schools in my home town, one primary school and one secondary school.
(11) I study in the secondary school and my younger sister studies in the primary school.
(12) I often ride my bike to school.

Statement: There is no air pollution in Kitty's home town.  

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Analyze the statement  
   - Content words: "no air pollution," "Kitty," "home town"

2. Locate supporting evidence in the passage  
   - Sentence (9): "The air in my home town is very fresh and clean."

3. Compare content words and expressions  
   - The evidence describes the air as "very fresh and clean," while the statement makes the stronger claim that there is "no air pollution."
   - "No air pollution" is a categorical assertion, whereas "fresh and clean" is qualitative and subjective.

4. Determine whether inference is required  
   - While "fresh and clean" air generally indicates low pollution, it does not definitively establish that there is no pollution.  
   - To conclude the total absence of air pollution from this description, a judgment or generalization must be made beyond the surface wording.
   - Therefore, it involves inference.

Answer: Inference

### Example 6

Passage: 
(1) "You know, these cups brings to my mind a story I heard," Mary said to her students.
(2) She poured some tea.
(3) There were four of them and there were four completely different cups on the tables.
(4) "I heard there was a teacher who took all his students for tea.
(5) His students were surprised that all the cups on the table were different.
(6) They all took a cup and started drinking their tea, each looking at the cups of others.
(7) The teacher said, "Did you notice your behavior?
(8) You are all looking at each other's tea cup and some of you even envy the finer cups of others."
(9) "I put the different cups here on purpose.
(10) I want to say life is like this tea.
(11) You all have the same thing in your cups----tea.
(12) And yet you cannot truly enjoy it in your envy of another's cup.
(13) You forget to enjoy your own life when you envy someone else's life.
(14) We all have the same thing----life.
(15) We should care more about the tastes of your own life. 

Statement: There was the same tea in different cups.  

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Analyze the statement  
   - Content words: "same tea," "different cups"

2. Locate supporting evidence in the passage  
   - Sentence (3): "There were four of them and there were four completely different cups on the tables."
   - Sentence (11): "You all have the same thing in your cups----tea."

3. Compare content words and expressions  
   - The statement summarizes the two observations: that the cups were different and that all cups contained the same tea.
   - The wording is compressed but accurately reflects the literal meaning of the two sentences.

4. Determine whether inference is required  
   - Both parts of the statement are stated explicitly in the passage.  
   - The statement simply combines them in a concise form without adding new meaning or interpretation.
   - No inference is needed.

Answer: Non-inference

### Example 7

Passage: 
(1) An air of anxious uncertainty spread throughout the small Indian camp as the sun dawned that morning.
(2) Some braves gathered beside a smoking campfire.
(3) Murmuring sounds could be heard as they talked quietly.
(4) Women nervously performed their domestic tasks, preparing a small meal.
(5) Several sad, old men sat mute, their morale very low.
(6) The camp was pitched at the edge of a deep valley--so deep that one could barely see the calm water at the bottom.
(7) The Indians had been taken by surprise and were surrounded and attacked by enemy forces.
(8) They fought bravely, but they were degraded by defeat.
(9) Their homes were destroyed.
(10) Those who had survived had been pursued by the enemy.
(11) The chase  had lasted for days.
(12) Persuaded by their leaders to press on, they had made a wrong turn.
(13) Their exhausting journey ended at the edge of a valley--a desperate situation.
(14) Before them was a great hole in the earth.
(15) Behind them was the enemy.
(16) No wonder they were frozen with fear.
(17) Where could they go?
(18) Just when no choice seemed available to them, several young braves ran into camp.

Statement: The Indians in the camp were in a serious situation because they took a wrong course.  

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Analyze the statement  
   - Content words: "Indians," "in the camp," "serious situation," "because," "took a wrong course"

2. Locate supporting evidence in the passage  
   - Sentence (12): "Persuaded by their leaders to press on, they had made a wrong turn."
   - Sentence (13): "Their exhausting journey ended at the edge of a valley--a desperate situation."

3. Compare content words and expressions  
   - "Took a wrong course" is a direct paraphrase of "made a wrong turn."
   - "Serious situation" is a paraphrase of "desperate situation."
   - The statement reverses the order of information: it gives the result first ("serious situation") and the reason second ("wrong course"), while the passage presents the reason first and then the result
   - "They" in the evidence refers to "The Indians in the camp" → anaphora resolution

4. Determine whether inference is required  
   - No inference is required.
   - The statement is constructed by paraphrasing and reordering the explicitly stated ideas.
   - Anaphora resolution is used to identify "they" as "the Indians in the camp," which is unambiguous from earlier context.

Answer: Non-inference

### Example 8

Passage: 
(1) Many people think sports are just for winning and honor, but there is a lot more you can gain from (get out of) them.
(2) I have learned over the past years that sometimes when I lose, I get a lot more out of it than winning.
(3) Also, I find a lot of times in sports, people are getting too caught up in the game instead of just having fun.
(4) The real purpose of sports is to have fun and learn life lessons along the way.
(5) I greatly encourage you to be a part of the school sports.
(6) Even if you are not the best, you can still have fun.
(7) Sports give people a great and healthy way of spending an afternoon, instead of lying around playing video games or even getting into bad things.
(8) Sports also give us a sense of achievement.
(9) There isn't a better feeling than to have done something fun and productive for my day.
(10) I think that we all need sports to give us courage.
(11) If we try hard in sports, we usually do well.
(12) If we did the same in study, we would all be champions.
(13) Another reason why I encourage you to play sports is that it's just fun.
(14) Without sports, our lives would just be boring.
(15) So as you may be able to tell, sports are amazing!
(16) Our coaches not only teach us to play sports, but show class and good sportsmanship while playing them.
(17) It's never fun when you lose to have the competitor rub it in your face.
(18) That's why our coaches teach us to show class when we lose; also, when coaches get mad , don't get down.
(19) They only want to see you improve and learn from what they say.
(20) When you do badly and they don't shout loudly is when you should start worrying because they are giving up on you.
(21) Overall, sports are great!
(22) They bring out the best and worst of a lot of us.
(23) However, we can' t let sports get too serious to where it brings down all the fun.
(24) So to have the most fun in sports, you just need try your best and not worry so much about the winning or losing.  

Statement: We should take pleasure in doing sports.  

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Analyze the statement  
   - Content words: "we," "should," "take pleasure," "doing sports"

2. Locate supporting evidence in the passage  
   - Sentence (4): "The real purpose of sports is to have fun and learn life lessons along the way."
   - Sentence (6): "Even if you are not the best, you can still have fun."
   - Sentence (13): "Another reason why I encourage you to play sports is that it's just fun."
   - Sentence (24): "So to have the most fun in sports, you just need try your best and not worry so much about the winning or losing."

3. Compare content words and expressions  
   - The phrase "take pleasure in doing sports" rephrases the repeated message that "sports are fun" or "you can still have fun."
   - The statement uses a generalized phrasing that synthesizes the idea across multiple lines.
   - No single sentence expresses exactly that "we should take pleasure in doing sports," but it is a natural summary of several lines.

4. Determine whether inference is required  
   - The statement involves integrating multiple lines that describe the value of fun and enjoyment in sports.
   - This synthesis across several sentences and abstraction into a general principle constitutes inference.
   - Therefore, it is an inference.
