### Example 1

Passage: 
(1) "Can I see my baby?" asked the happy new mother.
(2) When the baby was in her arms, she couldn't believe her eyes.
(3) The baby was born without ears.
(4) Time proved  that the baby's hearing was very good though he had no ears.
(5) He got on well with his classmates.
(6) But one day, he said to his mother, tears in his eyes, "A big boy called me a freak  ."  

Not True Statement: The boy couldn't hear without ears at first.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Understand the Statement
   - The statement claims that the boy was initially unable to hear due to having no ears, suggesting a delay in developing hearing ability.

2. Retrieve Relevant Information from the Passage
   - Sentence (3): "The baby was born without ears." → confirms he lacked ears.
   - Sentence (4): "Time proved that the baby's hearing was very good though he had no ears." → addresses the hearing ability directly.

3. Evaluate the Evidence
   - Sentence (4) directly contradicts the statement by stating that the baby had very good hearing despite having no ears.
   - The phrase "time proved" refers to discovery or confirmation over time, not a delayed development of hearing.
   - Therefore, the boy could hear from the beginning, and the statement is factually incorrect.

4. Check Sufficiency
   - Sentence (4) alone contains both the physical condition (no ears) and the auditory ability (good hearing), making it sufficient to refute the claim.
   - It addresses the main components of the statement without requiring additional support.

5. Anaphora Resolution
   - "The baby" in Sentence (4) is anaphoric and refers unambiguously to the same child introduced in Sentence (1).
   - Continuity of the character is maintained throughout the passage; no other potential referents are introduced.

6. Conclusion
   - Sentence (4) alone is enough to refute the statement. 
   - It clearly indicates that the boy always had good hearing, despite his lack of ears.

### Example 2

Passage: 
(1) It's a warm summer afternoon.
(2) You're cooking up the catch of the day over a campfire.
(3) Suddenly, a few raindrops fall on your arms, and before you know it, the sky is opened up.
(4) There's a campsite picnic shelter a few minutes down the path.
(5) And then you remember that your car is parked down the road.
(6) Heading to your car is almost always the safest choice.
(7) Your tent and a picnic shelter will keep you dry, but they offer little or no protection against lightening.
(8) Your car, on the other hand, will keep you dry and protect you from lightening strikes.
(9) Protecting yourself against possible lightening strikes is very important; lightening kills an average of 62 people in the US each year.
(10) If you keep all of the windows and doors closed in your car, you'll be able to return to your campsite safely.
(11) What else should you do?  

True Statement: Lightening is a danger for campers.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Understand the Statement
   - The statement claims that lightning is dangerous and that this danger specifically applies to campers.

2. Retrieve Relevant Information from the Passage
   - Sentence (9): "Protecting yourself against possible lightning strikes is very important; lightning kills an average of 62 people in the US each year." → explicitly states the danger.

3. Evaluate the Evidence
   - Sentence (9) establishes that lightning is a serious and potentially fatal threat.
   - The second-person pronoun “you” used in Sentence (9) clearly refers to a camper, as all previous sentences describe a camping situation.
   - Sentence (7) reinforces that common camping shelters don't provide safety from lightning.

4. Check Sufficiency
   - Sentence (9) alone conveys the danger of lightning.
   - Because “you” is used consistently in a camping context, “yourself” in Sentence (9) refers unambiguously to a camper, making Sentence (9) sufficient to support the statement.

5. Anaphora Resolution
   - “Yourself” in Sentence (9) refers back to “you,” which is used consistently in the passage's camping scenario.
   - The referent is unambiguous and centrally maintained throughout the passage.

6. Conclusion
   - Sentence (9) alone supports the truth of the statement.
   - It affirms lightning’s danger, and the use of “you” clearly references a camper based on the consistent camping context.

Answer: 1

### Example 3

Passage: 
(1) Do you obey the rules in your school?
(2) What do you think of your school rules?
(3) Are you allowed to dye   hair?
(4) A lot of school rules are similar around the world, but some are different.
(5) Some students may enjoy more freedom in some countries.
(6) But freedom doesn't mean "no rules".
(7) Every school has its own rules.
(8) There are some rules in Japanese schools.
(9) The students are not allowed to dye their hair and are supposed to keep their hair black.
(10) In Japan, students are not allowed to have part-time jobs.
(11) American schools have their own rules too.
(12) For example, at Morton High School, students are not allowed to choose their own clothes.
(13) They must get to school or leave school on time.
(14) Food, drinks or snacks shouldn't be taken into the classroom.

Not True Statement: The students can eat things in class in America.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Understand the Statement
   - The statement claims that students in America are allowed to eat in class, implying permissive classroom rules regarding food.

2. Retrieve Relevant Information from the Passage
   - Sentence (14): “Food, drinks or snacks shouldn't be taken into the classroom.” → directly contradicts the idea that students can eat in class.
   - Sentence (12): “For example, at Morton High School…” → identifies this school as an example of an American school, grounding Sentence (14) in the context of America.

3. Evaluate the Evidence
   - Sentence (14) says that food, drinks, or snacks are not allowed in the classroom, contradicting the claim that students can eat in class.
   - Sentence (12) shows that Morton High School is in America. Thus, the restriction in (14) applies to American students.
   - Since the statement is labeled “Not True,” this contradiction confirms the statement is indeed false.

4. Check Sufficiency
   - Sentence (14) provides the rule against eating in class, but on its own, it does not specify the geographic context.
   - Sentence (12) is necessary to confirm that the rule applies to an American school.
   - Therefore, both sentences are needed to fully refute the statement.

5. Anaphora Resolution
   - Sentence (14) uses no pronouns but does rely on context to identify that the rule applies to an American school.
   - Sentence (12) provides that context by introducing Morton High School as an example of a school in America.

6. Conclusion
   - Sentence (14) states the rule against bringing food into the classroom.
   - Sentence (12) connects that rule to an American school, thereby refuting the statement.
   - Both are needed to confidently determine the statement is not true.

Answer: 2

## Example 4

Passage: 
(1) My name is Nancy.
(2) I'm twelve years old.
(3) I have a good friend.
(4) Her name is Wendy.
(5) She is thirteen.
(6) She is from Australia.
(7) We are friends, but we are in different classes.
(8) Wendy is in Class Four and I'm in Class Three.
(9) I like green and blue but Wendy likes red and yellow.
(10) She is a good student, and all the students and teachers in her class like her.
(11) Wendy likes running, and she often runs after school.
(12) I like basketball and football.

True Statement: Everyone in Class Four likes Wendy.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Understand the Statement
   - The statement claims that all individuals in Class Four (students and teachers) like Wendy.

2. Retrieve Relevant Information from the Passage
   - Sentence (8): "Wendy is in Class Four and I'm in Class Three." → establishes Wendy's class.
   - Sentence (10): "She is a good student, and all the students and teachers in her class like her." → states that everyone in her class likes her.

3. Evaluate the Evidence
   - Sentence (10) asserts that all students and teachers in Wendy’s class like her.
   - Sentence (8) confirms that Wendy’s class is Class Four.
   - Taken together, these two statements confirm that everyone in Class Four likes Wendy.

4. Check Sufficiency
   - Sentence (10) refers to “her class” but does not specify “Class Four.”
   - Sentence (8) is needed to explicitly identify Wendy’s class as Class Four.
   - Therefore, both sentences are required to confidently support the statement.

5. Anaphora Resolution
   - Sentence (10) uses the pronoun “her” which refers to Wendy, introduced earlier and mentioned frequently.
   - Sentence (8) ties Wendy to Class Four, resolving the identity of “her class” in Sentence (10).

6. Conclusion
   - Sentence (10) states that everyone in Wendy’s class likes her.
   - Sentence (8) confirms that Wendy is in Class Four.
   - Both are necessary to verify that everyone in Class Four likes Wendy.
