### Example 2

Passage: 
(1) The Chinese tradition of giving gifts of money in red envelopes at Lunar New Year has turned into big business for Web giants Alibaba and Tencent, which now both offer electronic "hong bao".
(2) At the end of each lunar year, it is common in China to give children hong bao -- some money in envelopes that are red, the colour of success.
(3) It is now possible to exchange "red envelopes" with smartphone, which is popular in China and has caused a battle  for the mobile payment market between the two companies providing the service, Tencent and Alibaba.
(4) The idea was introduced in 2014 by WeChat, a mobile messaging system with over 400 million users and run[:]by Tencent, China's largest Internet service system.
(5) It was successful at once.
(6) This year, Alipay Wallet , the payment system run by Alibaba, is ready to take on the competition.
(7) It is allowing its 190 million users to send digital gifts, especially on the Twitter-like Sina Weibo.
(8) For the past few weeks a digital battle has been terrible, with Tencent banning  Alipay from sending red envelopes on WeChat, saying they were at a risk.
(9) Recently, WeChat also blocked  Alibaba's music app Xiami.
(10) To attract the public's attention, the two companies have launched lotteries through which they award red envelopes to users in an online game.
(11) It's easy to send and receive hong bao or take part in the lotteries: you simply need to register  your bank details.

Statement: The idea of electronic red envelope was introduced by Wechat in 2014.  

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Analyze the Statement  
   - Content words: idea, electronic red envelope, introduced, WeChat, 2014

2. Locate Supporting Evidence in the Passage
   - Sentence (4): "The idea was introduced in 2014 by WeChat..."

3. Compare Semantically Aligned Content
   - "idea of electronic red envelope" ↔ "The idea" — anaphoric resolution from previous sentences referring to electronic “hong bao”
   - "introduced" ↔ "introduced" — exact match
   - "WeChat" ↔ "WeChat" — exact match
   - "2014" ↔ "2014" — exact match

4. Compare Phrase Order
   - Evidence: "was introduced in 2014 by WeChat"
   - Statement: "was introduced by WeChat in 2014"
   - The phrases "by WeChat" and "in 2014" have swapped positions — this is a meaningful reordering of semantically aligned elements.

Passage: 
(1) A young man woke up one morning under a bridge and checked his pocket.
(2) All he had left was less than ten dollars.
(3) He bought food and as he sat down to eat, an old man and two children came along.

(9) The old man insisted  that the young man put it in his pocket---and finally he did.
(10) The old man and children sat down to eat.
(11) And with no money, no job and no food, the young man went back under the bridge to lie down.

   - "needed the coin more than he did" ↔ "You need this coin more than I do" — direct semantic alignment with resolved pronouns

4. Compare Phrase Order
   - Evidence: "You need this coin more than I do"
   - Statement: "The old man needed the coin more than he did"
   - The clause structure and ordering of elements ("[subject] needed [object] more than [subject2]") are preserved exactly.
