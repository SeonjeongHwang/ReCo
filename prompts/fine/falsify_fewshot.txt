### Example 1

Passage: 
(1) "Can I see my baby?" asked the happy new mother.
(2) When the baby was in her arms, she couldn't believe her eyes.
(3) The baby was born without ears.
(4) Time proved  that the baby's hearing was very good though he had no ears.
(5) He got on well with his classmates.
(6) But one day, he said to his mother, tears in his eyes, "A big boy called me a freak  ."  

Not True Statement: The boy couldn't hear without ears at first.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Understand the Statement
   - Statement: "The boy couldn't hear without ears at first."
   - Label: Not True
   - Key claim: The boy was initially unable to hear due to being born without ears.

2. Retrieve Relevant Information from the Passage
   - Sentence (3): States the baby was born without ears.
   - Sentence (4): States that his hearing was very good despite that.

3. Assess Scope of Evidence
   - Sentence (4) directly contradicts the claim.
   - It clearly references both the boy’s physical condition (no ears) and his ability (good hearing).

Answer: Contradiction

### Example 2

Passage: 
(1) Do you obey the rules in your school?
(2) What do you think of your school rules?
(3) Are you allowed to dye   hair?
(4) A lot of school rules are similar around the world, but some are different.
(5) Some students may enjoy more freedom in some countries.
(6) But freedom doesn't mean "no rules".
(7) Every school has its own rules.
(8) There are some rules in Japanese schools.
(9) The students are not allowed to dye their hair and are supposed to keep their hair black.
(10) In Japan, students are not allowed to have part-time jobs.
(11) American schools have their own rules too.
(12) For example, at Morton High School, students are not allowed to choose their own clothes.
(13) They must get to school or leave school on time.
(14) Food, drinks or snacks shouldn't be taken into the classroom.

Not True Statement: The students can eat things in class in America.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Understand the Statement  
   - Statement: "The students can eat things in class in America."
   - Label: Not True
   - Key claim: American students are allowed to eat in class.

2. Retrieve Relevant Information from the Passage  
   - Sentence (11): Introduces American schools.
   - Sentence (14): "Food, drinks or snacks shouldn't be taken into the classroom."

3. Assess Scope of Evidence  
   - Sentence (14) directly refutes the claim.

Answer: Contradiction

### Example 3

Passage: 
(1) Hello!
(2) My name is Kitty.
(3) I want to talk about my home town today.
(4) My home town is small but pretty.
(5) It's about two hours away from London by train.
(6) In the centre of the town there is a small lake.
(7) There are lots of trees and flowers around the lake.
(8) My parents often walk around the lake at the weekend.
(9) The air in my home town is very fresh   and clean.
(10) There are two schools in my home town, one primary school and one secondary school.
(11) I study in the secondary school and my younger sister studies in the primary school.
(12) I often ride my bike to school.
(13) I usually go to the youth centre to learn drawing with my sister on Friday afternoons.
(14) I like going shopping at the weekend.
(15) There are two big shopping malls there.  

Not True Statement: Kitty often takes a walk with her friends around the lake.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Understand the Statement  
   - Statement: "Kitty often takes a walk with her friends around the lake."
   - Label: Not True
   - Key claim: Kitty and her friends often walk around the lake.

2. Retrieve Relevant Information from the Passage  
   - Sentence (6): Describes the location of the lake.
   - Sentence (7): Describes the scenery around the lake.
   - Sentence (8): "My parents often walk around the lake at the weekend." → The only mention of walking around the lake.

3. Assess Scope of Evidence  
   - No sentence states that Kitty or her friends walk around the lake.
   - The passage is silent on Kitty's walking habits there.
   - No contradiction, but also no support.

Answer: Insufficient

### Example 4

Passage: 
(1) As part of an effort to improve treatments for life-threatening illnesses, a team of scientists have created rabbits that glow in the dark.
(2) The efforts have produced two rabbits out of a litter of eight that went from being a normal, soft white to glowing green in the dark.
(3) The rabbits were born at the University of Istanbul as part of the cooperation between scientists from universities in Turkey and Hawaii.
(4) The rabbits glow to show that a genetic operation technique can work efficiently.
(5) "The green is not important at all--it's just a marker to show the experiment can be done successfully," said University of Hawaii associate professor, Stefan Moisyadi.
(6) To produce the glowing effect, researchers injected jellyfish DNA into a mother rabbit's embryos.
(7) Then those embryos were put into the mother.
(8) Similar experiments have resulted in glowing cockroaches  and cats.
(9) Eventually, the researchers hope the technique can lead to new ways to produce medicines, Moisyadi said.
(10) "The final goal is to develop animals that are able to produce beneficial molecules in their milk that can be cheaply extracted , especially in countries that cannot afford big factories that make drugs, which usually cost US$1bn to build.
(11) Then they will be able to produce their own protein-based medication in animals," Moisyadi said.
(12) The rabbits are expected to live as long as non-glowing rabbits, but Moisyadi said he understands people can object to this kind of experimentation involving live animals.
(13) "To the people against, I say: think, what are the benefits and what is the harm?" Moisyadi said.
(14) "And if the benefits outweigh the harm, let's go with the benefits."
(15) Moisyadi started developing the project in 2006, and researchers are now waiting to see if pregnant sheep produce similar results.  

Not True Statement: The success rate in creating the rabbits is 20%.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Understand the Statement  
   - Statement: "The success rate in creating the rabbits is 20%."
   - Label: Not True
   - Key claim: There is a quantified success rate (20%) in creating rabbits.

2. Retrieve Relevant Information from the Passage  
   - Sentence (2): “The efforts have produced two rabbits out of a litter of eight that went from being a normal, soft white to glowing green in the dark.” → 2 glowing rabbits out of 8 born.
   - No mention of total embryos used, implantation attempts, or expectations for success.

3. Assess Scope of Evidence  
   - The statement uses "success rate," but the passage lacks context for defining the base population (e.g., embryos injected, expected outcomes).
   - It’s unclear whether "20%" refers to glowing results or something else.
   - Without clear denominator data, we cannot confirm or refute the 20% rate.

Answer: Insufficient
