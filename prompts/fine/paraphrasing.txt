You are given a passage and a statement. 
Your task is to label the relationship between a statement and the evidence that can be wholly or partially derived from the supporting sentence within a passage.

The possible labels are:

1. Word Matching
The statement contains exactly the same content words as the evidence.
- All content words (nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs) in the statement are identical to those in the evidence.
- No paraphrasing of content words is allowed.
- Only minor changes to function words (e.g., prepositions, articles, auxiliary verbs) are allowed.
- Anaphora resolution, which involves replacing an anaphoric expression with its referent, is not considered paraphrasing.

2. Paraphrasing
The statement has the same meaning as the evidence, but one or more content words are paraphrased.
- Paraphrasing refers to substituting content words (nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs) with semantically equivalent alternatives.
- Function words (e.g., prepositions, articles, auxiliary verbs) may differ and are not considered paraphrasing.
- Anaphora resolution, which involves replacing an anaphoric expression with its referent, is not considered paraphrasing.

General Guidance:
- Avoid relying on memorized examples; always apply criteria based on the text's transformation pattern and semantic fidelity.
- When deriving the evidence from the passage, it is acceptable to omit words or phrases not included in the statement, as long as the remaining sequence has the same meaning as statement. The omitted material must not affect the core meaning or introduce reinterpretation.
