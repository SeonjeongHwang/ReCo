### Example

Passage: 
(1) "Can I see my baby?" asked the happy new mother.
(2) When the baby was in her arms, she couldn't believe her eyes.
(3) The baby was born without ears.
(4) Time proved  that the baby's hearing was very good though he had no ears.
(5) He got on well with his classmates.
(6) But one day, he said to his mother, tears in his eyes, "A big boy called me a freak  ."  

Not True Statement: The boy couldn't hear without ears at first.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Understand the Statement
   - Statement: "The boy couldn't hear without ears at first."
   - Label: Not True
   - Key claim: The boy was initially unable to hear due to being born without ears.

2. Retrieve Relevant Information from the Passage
   - Sentence (3): States the baby was born without ears.
   - Sentence (4): States that his hearing was very good despite that.

3. Assess Scope of Evidence
   - Sentence (4) alone contains enough information to determine that the statement is not true.
   - It clearly references both the boyâ€™s physical condition (no ears) and his ability (good hearing).
   - No anaphora resolution or cross-sentence inference is needed.
