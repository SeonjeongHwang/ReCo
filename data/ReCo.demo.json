         "Engineers should embrace the arts as being key to creativity and an important component of innovation , crucial to creating new products and boosting future competitiveness, he argued.",

         "\"Aesthetics  is part of it,\" he told the reporter, adding that Apple's iPod was not the first digital media player, nor the only one that worked - but it came to dominate the market \"because it was nice to have\".",
         "Sir John said he was not suggesting universities started requiring A-level art from engineering applicants - the key subjects for admission would continue to be maths and the sciences.",
         "But an emphasis on creative skills would help \"broaden the pool and attract more people in\"."
